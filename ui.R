# This is the user interface part of a Shiny application. The application takes an address
#of a property alongside 3 binar;y factors (old or new build, flat or terrace, leasehold or
#freehold) and predicts the properties price using a k-nearest neighbours model.
#The location of the property is plotted alongide the data used to build the model.
